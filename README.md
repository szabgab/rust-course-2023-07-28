## Session 1

* Sales-pitch - why learn Rust?

* Speed - on par with C and C++ ??
* Memory safety

* Strong static type system
* No garbage collection


Open source projects that were written in Rust, but are used by not necessarily Rust programmers.

* [Slint](https://slint.dev/) GUI design language.
* [SurrealDB](https://surrealdb.com/) multi-model database
* [Fish Folk](https://fishfolk.org/) game

* [MeiliSearch](https://www.meilisearch.com/)
* Components of [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)
* In the [Linux kernel](https://docs.kernel.org/rust/index.html)

* [Awesome Rust](https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust)
* [Awesome Alternatives in Rust](https://github.com/TaKO8Ki/awesome-alternatives-in-rust)


* [Ruff](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/) a very fast Python linter
* [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/

* Install Rust

* `cargo new demo`

* println! print!   eprintln!   eprint!  dbg!  format!  (macros, metaprogramming)

* Exercise: install, hello world

* variable with fixed string, print string

* variable with numbers
* types of numbers
* operations with numbers

* function declaration passing numbers, returning numbers

* Exercise: function that gets two numbers and returns their sum
* Exercise: function that gets two numbers and divedes them

* `if` statement

* Exercise: calculator function that gets 2 numbers and an operator (+,-,*,/) and returns the result

* `for` loop on range `for i in 1..5 {}`, break , continue

* Exercise: factorial function (given a number return n!)



## Session 2

* mutable variables

* shadowing variables (redeclare)
