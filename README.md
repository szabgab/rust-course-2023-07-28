## Session 1

* Sales-pitch - why learn Rust?

* Speed - on par with C and C++ ??
* Memory safety

* Strong static type system
* No garbage collection


Open source projects that were written in Rust, but are used by not necessarily Rust programmers.

* [Slint](https://slint.dev/) GUI design language.
* [SurrealDB](https://surrealdb.com/) multi-model database


* Install Rust

* `cargo new demo`

* println! print!   eprintln!   eprint!  dbg!  format!  (macros, metaprogramming)

* Exercise: install, hello world

* variable with fixed string, print string

* variable with numbers
* types of numbers
* operations with numbers

* function declaration passing numbers, returning numbers

* Exercise: function that gets two numbers and returns their sum
* Exercise: function that gets two numbers and divedes them

* `if` statement

* Exercise: calculator function that gets 2 numbers and an operator (+,-,*,/) and returns the result

* `for` loop on range `for i in 1..5 {}`, break , continue

* Exercise: factorial function (given a number return n!)



## Session 2

* mutable variables

* shadowing variables (redeclare)
